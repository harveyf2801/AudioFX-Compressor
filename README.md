# AudioFX - Compressor

This project implements an audio compressor plugin using JUCE and C++. The compressor applies dynamic range compression to audio signals.

## Features

### Completed

- Threshold, Ratio, Attack, Release, and Makeup Gain controls for fine-tuning compression parameters.
- Adjustable knee setting for smooth transition between compressed and uncompressed audio.

### To do
- Visual feedback of gain reduction.
- Side-chain support for more advanced compression techniques.
- Implementation of other compression types i.e. downwards / upwards, expander, limiters, gates, multiband.

## Building the project
When building the project, make sure to download the whole repo and open the project through the ProJucer aplication.
