# JUCE Compressor

A compressor created using C++ in JUCE. This project is part of my coursework for the Audio Software Development module.

## Description
This project will aims to create a compressor audio plugin to be used as either standalone or in a VST / AU format.

## Installation
When downloading the project, make sure to download the whole repo and open the project through JUCE, not through the VisualStudio project file.

## Support
For futher support, contact on discord _**@harveyf2801**_.

## Roadmap
In future updates, more visuals will be included i.e. a graph showing the compression taking place and an oscilloscope showing before and after compression. Other types of compression will be included such as noise gates, limiters, expansion, and upwards/downwards compression.
