# JUCE Compressor

A compressor created using C++ in JUCE. This project is part of my coursework for the Audio Software Development module.

## Description
This project will aim to create a compressor audio plugin to be used as either standalone or in a VST format. Both peak and RMS detection will be tested to see which gives the best response (both options may be included in the final project). The user interface will be customisable and provide different colour themes to the user.

## Installation
When downloading the project, make sure to download the whole repo and open the project through JUCE, not through the VisualStudio project file.

## Support
For futher support, contact on discord _**@harveyf2801**_.

## Roadmap
In future updates, more visuals will be included i.e. a graph showing the compression taking place and an oscilloscope showing before and after compression. A limiting function will also be included.
